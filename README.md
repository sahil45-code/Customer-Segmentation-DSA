# 🧩 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## 📁 Project Overview

This project is part of the **RISE Internship - Data Science & Analytics Program** by Jamizan Skills. The goal is to apply **unsupervised machine learning** to segment customers based on behavioral data and help businesses target different customer groups effectively.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to personalize offerings due to a lack of customer segmentation. This project addresses the need to categorize customers based on behavioral patterns such as age, income, frequency of visits, and spending habits.

## 🎯 Objective

To implement a **K-Means Clustering** algorithm for customer segmentation using key demographic and transactional data, enabling more personalized marketing strategies.

## 📋 Requirements

The project fulfills the following requirements:

- ✅ Use **K-Means Clustering** on a dataset containing:
  - Age
  - Annual Income
  - Purchase Frequency
  - Spending Score
- ✅ Preprocess the data:
  - Normalize or scale features
  - Handle missing or irrelevant data
- ✅ Visualize results:
  - 2D and/or 3D scatter plots for cluster interpretation
  - Cluster centroids and boundaries

## 🧾 Dataset Structure

| Column Name      | Description                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| CustomerID       | Unique customer identifier          |
| Age              | Age of the customer                 |
| Income           | Annual income                       |
| Spending Score   | Composite score based on behavior   |
| Frequency        | Visit or purchase frequency         |

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Matplotlib 📈
- Seaborn 🎨
- Jupyter Notebook 📒

## 🧪 Implementation Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Imported dataset into a DataFrame
   - Checked for nulls and cleaned the data

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Applied standard scaling using `StandardScaler`
   - Selected relevant features for clustering

3. **Modeling: K-Means Clustering**
   - Determined optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method
   - Applied `KMeans` algorithm from `sklearn.cluster`
   - Assigned cluster labels to each customer

4. **Visualization**
   - Created 2D scatter plots with color-coded clusters
   - Used 3D scatter plots (if applicable) for better clarity
   - Annotated centroids for business interpretation

## 📊 Expected Outcome

- Clustering model that groups customers into **3–5 meaningful segments**
- Visual insights into:
  - High-value vs low-value customer groups
  - Behavioral patterns for targeted marketing
- A reusable customer segmentation pipeline

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation-kmeans.git
